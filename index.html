    <h1>Derek Mayse</h1>

    <p>I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. There he comes. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. It's all a game of angles.

        Put it in, leave it alone. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it.
        
        See there how easy that is. You can create anything that makes you happy. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. A happy cloud. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.
        
        This is truly an almighty mountain. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. That's a son of a gun of a cloud.
        
        Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Let's make a happy little mountain now. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be.
        
        We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Let the paint work. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Just a little indication.
        
        We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. You gotta think like a tree. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy.
